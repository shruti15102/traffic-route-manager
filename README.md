Using Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm, the application calculates the shortest path based on user-defined travel times between points (nodes). The system provides an interactive 
interface where users can add routes, input locations, and instantly see the fastest path visualized on a graph.
Technologies Used:
Python for backend logic
NetworkX for graph modeling and shortest path calculations
Matplotlib for graph visualization
